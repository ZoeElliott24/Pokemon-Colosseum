# Pokemon-Colosseum
Individual project in python to create an interactive pokemon colosseum for players to use to play against "Team Rocket". Both teams receive three random Pokemon to start the battle. When one team loses all three of their pokemon before the other, they lose. 

To run the program, please use main(PokemonColosseum.py). PokemonColosseum.py will call Pokemon.py and PokemonMoves.py
based off of the def. in PokemonColosseum.py. PyCharm was used as a virtual environment.
